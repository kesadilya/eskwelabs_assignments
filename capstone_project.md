# CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Problem Statement:
I want to automate decision-making in execution of procurement operations. 

## Goal/End product:
I want to create a decision algorithm that would suggest what to do with a specific outstanding purchase request whether to:
a. Not to proceed with the purchase and instead withdraw from inventory, as the certain good in the purchase request is still available in stock;
b. Combine the request with other purchase requests given the same good/ group of items; and
c. Combine the outstanding purchase request with other related services- which would entail setting up a contract for the purchase.

## Background:
Procurement operations has mostly been based on hard business rules - whether an established safety stock level of inventory, or ingrained strategies of bundling based on the buyer who executes it. 

Bundling is a strategy being done by the buyers of the organization, but has proved to be tedious as they themselves have to research and ask different departments before proceeding with their purchase. It is very important as it promotes savings - discount on bulk purchases, and efficiency in processing the purchase order, effectively leading in faster deliveries.

## Knowledge on the data:
I have worked with the company's procurement data for almost 10 months, so I am familiar with how I am going to clean the data - this would involve standardizing vendor names, converting dates appropriately to allow for arithmetical operations, and merging different data sources to other lookup tables. I am also limiting the analysis to goods as data on services does not have a refined granularity. 

## Why I chose this topic:
I chose this topic because I know it would be beneficial to the company I am working with right now - it would provide value, and cost savings.
