# CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Problem Statement:
I want to predict bundling opportunities for all goods that are bought in Energy Development Corporation. 

## Background:
A same item can be bought by different departments from different vendors (differences may only be minor specs, such as color, or material). These occurrences happen 50% of the time, and it would include relatively small items (31% of overall purchasing volume per year), ranging from indirect materials, to power plant items such as screws, and bolts.

## Knowledge on the data:
Bundling is a strategy being done by the buyers of the organization, but has proved to be tedious as they themselves have to research and ask different departments before proceeding with their purchase.It is very important as it promotes savings - discount on bulk purchases, and efficiency in processing the purchase order, effectively leading in faster deliveries.

## Goal/End product:
Create a prediction algorithm to check a purchase requisition whether it can be bundled with other available outstanding purchase requisitions.
