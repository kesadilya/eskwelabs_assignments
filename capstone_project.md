# CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Problem Statement:
I want to predict bundling opportunities for all goods that are bought in Energy Development Corporation. 

## Goal/End product:
Create a prediction algorithm to check what outstanding purchase requisitions can be bundled together. This would entail creating clusters of similar items, and deciding whether it is viable for bundling, or not. 

## Background:
50% of the time, similar items have been bought by different departments from different vendors (differences may only be minor specs, such as color, or material). This would include relatively small items, about 31% of overall purchasing volume per year, ranging from indirect materials, to power plant items such as screws, and bolts. 

Bundling is a strategy being done by the buyers of the organization, but has proved to be tedious as they themselves have to research and ask different departments before proceeding with their purchase. It is very important as it promotes savings - discount on bulk purchases, and efficiency in processing the purchase order, effectively leading in faster deliveries.

## Knowledge on the data:
I have worked with the company's procurement data for almost 10 months, so I am familiar with how I am going to clean the data - this would involve standardizing vendor names, converting dates appropriately to allow for arithmetical operations, and merging different data sources to other lookup tables. I am also limiting the analysis to goods as data on services does not have a refined granularity. 

## Why I chose this topic:
I chose this topic because I know it would be beneficial to the company I am working with right now - it would provide value, and cost savings.
